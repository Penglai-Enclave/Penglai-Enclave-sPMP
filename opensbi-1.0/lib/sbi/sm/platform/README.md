## Platforms

Penglai is designed to naturally support different platforms with their own isolation methods.

Currently, it supports:

- PMP-only platforms: this is suitable for most devices
- PMP + sPMP/MPU: Penglai can achieve better scalability with sPMP/MPU
- TVM (or Guarded Paging): please refer to another repo for more details about TVM
